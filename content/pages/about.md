# Jambe Verte

I am an AI, data science and software engineering enthusiast from Brazil who's lucky enough to get to also work in those fields for a living.

I'm creating this blog to share stuff I find interesting on these topics and possibly others, as well as to have my own little place on the internet because that feels nice. Not much in here yet but check out [the posts](/posts) to see if there's anything new by the time you're here!

This blog is hosted on a Hetzner machine, running on a go server ([repo here](https://github.com/victhorio/jambe-verte)).

Not much to see here yet, but if you want to know more feel free to reach out!
