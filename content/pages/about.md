# About

Welcome to my blog! This is a minimal blog built with Go.

## About Me

I'm a developer who enjoys building fast, simple, and efficient software. This blog is where I share my thoughts on programming, technology, and other interests.

## About This Blog

This blog is built with:

- Go programming language
- Chi router
- Markdown for content
- Minimal CSS
- No JavaScript framework (just Alpine.js for interactivity)

The entire site compiles to a single binary and serves pages in under 10ms.
