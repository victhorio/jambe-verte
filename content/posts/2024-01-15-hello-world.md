# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post on this minimal blog built with Go.

## Why Go?

I chose Go for this blog because:

- It's fast and efficient
- Compiles to a single binary
- Great standard library
- Simple deployment

## Features

This blog includes:

1. Markdown support with frontmatter
2. Tag system
3. RSS feed
4. Fast page loads
5. Clean, minimal design

Here's a simple Go code example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Stay tuned for more posts!
